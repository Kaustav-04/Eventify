## Overview of the App

<table>
<tr>
<td>
A complete Decentralized Event Management Portal
</td>
</tr>
</table>

We work for two genres of users - Organisers and Attendees

1. <b>For Organizers</b> 
- We provide them with slots to fill up their event details, we send mails to the pre-registered users informing them about the events.
- We provide them with various Templates for banners, tickets and certificates for their events and we use that for our entire Event Management System.
- We keep a record of their attendees.



2. <b>For Attendees</b> 
- We are providing them with information about different types of Technical events.
- We provide them NFT tickets as they register for an event with a few clicks.
- We also provide them with NFT certificates that can't be faked and are accessible any time.
- They can trust us as we rely on a piece of code and no third party is involved.
