## Overview of the App

<table>
<tr>
<td>
A complete Decentralized Event Management Portal
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Eventify is a decentralized event management solution that helps organizers streamline the process of distributing certificates and tickets while ensuring their authenticity. By converting certificates and tickets into non-fungible tokens involving smart contracts, Eventify reduces the number of fake tickets and certificates, ensuring that only interested participants attend an event.

The platform offers a variety of templates that organizers can use throughout the event management system, including banners, tickets, and certificates. Participants can easily register for an event and receive NFT tickets and certifications that are always available and unforgeable.

## Features: 
1. Generates OnChain Certificates and Tickets and store them on IPFS-NFTStorage.
2. Airdrop or lazy mint to their recipients.
3. Provides information to participants about various categories of technical events.
4. Streamlines the security of an event by digitizing the certificate and tickets.
5. Reduces the number of fake tickets and certificates.
6. Easy registration process for participants.
7. NFT certifications that are always available and unforgeable.

## Sections of our Project
We work for two genres of users - Organisers and Attendees

1. <b>For Organizers</b> 
- We provide them with slots to fill up their event details, we send mails to the pre-registered users informing them about the events.
- We provide them with various Templates for banners, tickets and certificates for their events and we use that for our entire Event Management System.
- We keep a record of their attendees.



2. <b>For Attendees</b> 
- We are providing them with information about different types of Technical events.
- We provide them NFT tickets as they register for an event with a few clicks.
- We also provide them with NFT certificates that can't be faked and are accessible any time.
- They can trust us as we rely on a piece of code and no third party is involved.

---------

## How it works
1. Organizers create an event and enter relevant information.
2. Eventify generates OnChain Certificates and Tickets for the event and stores them on IPFS-NFTStorage.
3. Participants register for the event and receive NFT tickets.
4. After the event, participants receive NFT certificates.
